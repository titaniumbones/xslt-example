# Toy XSLT Practice Repo

This is a trivial repository that contains a simple XML file, the XSLT file to transform it, and a very short JavaScript ifle that acts on the resultant DOM when it's loaded into a browser.  It's intended for studnet projects that manipulate text systematically after a call to an API.
