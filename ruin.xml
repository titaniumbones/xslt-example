<l n="1">This <concrete-noun>wall-stone</concrete-noun> is <adjective>wondrous</adjective>; <hyperbole>fates broke it</hyperbole></l>
<l n="2"><concrete-noun>courtyard pavements</concrete-noun> were smashed; the work of giants is decaying.</l>
<l n="3"><concrete-noun>Roofs</concrete-noun> are fallen, ruinous <concrete-noun>towers</concrete-noun>,</l>
<l n="4"> the frosty gate with <synonym>frost</synonym> on cement is <hard-word>ravaged</hard-word>, </l>

  <l n="1"><adjective>Wondrous</adjective>
  is this wall-stead, wasted by fate.</l>

  <l n="2">Battlements broken, giantâ€™s work shattered.</l>

  <l n="3">Roofs are in ruin, towers destroyed,</l>

  <l n="4">Broken the barred gate, rime on the plaster,</l>

  <l n="5">walls gape, torn up, destroyed,</l>

  <l n="6">consumed by age. Earth-grip holds</l>

  <l n="7">the <adjective>proud</adjective> builders, departed, long lost,</l>

  <l n="8">and the <adjective>hard</adjective> grasp of the grave, until a hundred generations</l>

  <l n="9">of people have passed. Often this wall outlasted,</l>

  <l n="10"><adjective>hoary</adjective> with lichen, <adjective>red-stained,</adjective> withstanding the storm,</l>

  <l n="11">one reign after another; the <adjective>high</adjective> arch has now fallen.</l>

  <l n="12">The wall-stone still stands, hacked by weapons,</l>

  <l n="13">by <adjective>grim-ground</adjective> files.</l>
